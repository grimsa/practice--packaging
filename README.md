### Overview

This set of minimal examples inspired by a real project attempts to showcase several challenges related to organizing classes into a package hierarchy.

Each example (case) has a related GitHub Discussions topic:

1. `case-1` - ["Packages should not depend on subpackages" rule](https://github.com/grimsa/practice--packaging/discussions/1)
2. `case-2` - [Implications of extracting a library](https://github.com/grimsa/practice--packaging/discussions/2)

There are also some discussion topics without related examples:

- ["Sub-packages should not introduce new concepts, just more details" rule](https://github.com/grimsa/practice--packaging/discussions/5)
